A C++ review for how to use it lol. Also overcomplicated some of it for more refreshing and threading practice.

Based off the solution to a riddle:

You have 100 prisoners with a number. Each of the prisoner's ID is written on a piece of paper and stored in one of 100 boxes. Each prisoner can enter the room of boxes, and look in a maximum of 50 boxes. If every prisoner finds their own individual number then they all go free. If any one of them do not, they all die. They cannot collaborate in anyway once they are in jail, and they cannot manipulate any boxes. They only have time to collaborate before entering the prison.
